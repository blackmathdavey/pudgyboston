Homemade butternut squash and potato gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce from the pasta book Homemade Pasta Made Simple. Fun night in keeping warm and cooking to jazz.

The homemade sauce turned out thick, creamy, and paired excellent with the flavors of the gnocchi. But therein lied our problem, the chopped not riced butternut squash resulted in gnocchi that was a little too thick; each bite was a mouthful. The flavors were there, but the mouthfeel and consistancy were a little much.

Forgot to take more pictures :man_facepalming: but here's the sole photo: Gnocchi rolled and cut ready to be cooked.
